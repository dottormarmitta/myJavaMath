# myJavaMath

In the following I am trying to build a raw calculator, with functioning similar to Java Math class.
Doing so, I want to avoid any usage of external libraries.

This code can be copied, used and modified always citing the author: @GuglielmoDelSarto

I am collaborating with @LeonardoScoppitto from CS course at University of Pisa


** Code style and function names **

We try to stick with usual Java convention of CamelCase names.
Function here are presented in the following way:
 - getSomethingYouWant(...) if they are supposed to be called by the user
 - performSomethingYouWant(...) if they are just some auxiliary functions
